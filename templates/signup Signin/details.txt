(4). Aesthetic/Theme: Generate themes like 'Neon Cyberpunk', 'Minimalist E-commerce', 'Dark Mode Professional', 'Vibrant Memphis Design', 'Glassmorphism Blur', 'Nature/Organic Greens', 'Brutalist Text-Heavy', and 'Soft Pastel Flat Design'.

Toggle Animation: Vary the transition (e.g., Slide/Translate, Flip/Rotate, Fade-in/Fade-out, 3D perspective change).

Form Layout: Change the form arrangement (e.g., Full-width inputs, Floating labels, Two-column layout on desktop).

Button Style: Use different button styles (Pill-shaped, Squared with sharp shadows, Gradient fill, Outline only).

Background: Use various backgrounds (e.g., Geometric pattern, Subtle animated gradient, Parallax image scroll, Abstract SVG blob)."

_______________________________________________________________________________________
(5). Visual Theme: Use a clean, friendly, and slightly vibrant aesthetic with a soft background gradient (e.g., light green to light blue).

Colors: Primary action color should be a modern green (#28a745), with dark text and subtle grey inputs.

Typography: Use a clean, sans-serif font like 'Lato'.

Form Structure: Include fields for 'Email', 'Password' (on both sides) and 'Full Name' (on sign-up).

Interactivity:

A prominent button on each form to trigger the flip to the other form.

Social login icons (Google, Facebook, GitHub) clearly visible.

Basic client-side form validation (e.g., required attributes and a simple alert on submit).

_______________________________________________________________________________________
(6). I need a single HTML/CSS/JS file for a sign-in/sign-up form using the Neumorphism design aesthetic. The entire form should be a single, large, extruded card.

Interaction Style: Use a Tab Switch mechanism instead of a sliding or flipping animation. The tabs must be prominent buttons at the top of the card that trigger a smooth fade/transition between the Sign-In and Sign-Up form content within the same card.

Design Requirements:

Background/Base: Use a single, light grey/off-white color (#e0e5ec) for the entire background and form container.

Shadows: Implement the signature Neumorphism shadows (light and dark) on the main container, the tab buttons (inset/pressed when active), and the input fields (inset).

Accent Color: Use a single, vibrant, non-blue color like Coral/Soft Red (#ff6b6b) for button text and active states.

Inputs: Inputs must have the inset shadow effect.

Social Icons: Integrate social icons with a circular Neumorphism (extruded) effect that 'presses in' on hover.

Functionality: Include a smooth opacity and translateY transition for the form content switch."

_______________________________________________________________________________________
(7). I need a single HTML/CSS/JS file for a sign-in/sign-up page that uses a Glassmorphism design aesthetic.

Interaction Style: The login and registration forms should be within a single, wide, frosted glass container. When switching between forms, the currently visible form should slide out to the side (e.g., left), and the new form should slide in from the opposite side (e.g., right). The background should remain visible but blurred through the forms.

Design Requirements:

Background: Use a vibrant, deep gradient background (e.g., purples or blues) for the entire page.

Form Container: The main container holding both forms must have a transparent white background (rgba(255,255,255,0.2)), a subtle border, a strong box-shadow, and crucially, a backdrop-filter: blur(10px).

Inputs: Input fields should also have a slightly transparent background and subtle blur, with placeholder text in a lighter shade for contrast.

Typography: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font like 'Montserrat'.

Colors: Use the background gradient colors (deep purple/blue) as primary accents for buttons and interactive elements, with white/light grey for text on dark backgrounds, and dark text on lighter glass backgrounds.

Buttons: Style buttons with solid color fills that subtly transform on hover, and separate toggle buttons with a frosted glass appearance.

Social Icons: Include simple, prominent social media icons (Google, Facebook, Apple) that change color on hover."
